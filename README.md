# github-action-trunk-upgrade

## Purpose and Functionality

A reusable GitHub Action for automated [Trunk](https://trunk.io) upgrades with status check handling and auto-merge.

This action automates the process of keeping your Trunk configuration up-to-date by creating pull requests for upgrades and automatically merging them after status checks pass. It follows security best practices with dual-token authentication and only waits for required status checks, avoiding unnecessary delays from optional checks.

## Usage

### Prerequisites

- GitHub repository with Trunk configuration
- GitHub App credentials (recommended) or Personal Access Token
- Repository permissions: `contents: write` and `pull-requests: write`

### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Set up authentication secrets** in your repository:
   - `BOT_APP_ID` - GitHub App ID
   - `BOT_APP_PRIVATE_KEY` - GitHub App private key
   - `ORG_PAT` - Personal Access Token with admin permissions

2. **Create workflow file** `.github/workflows/trunk-upgrade.yml`:

```yaml
name: Trunk Upgrade
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: 0 9 1 * * # Monthly on the 1st at 9am
  workflow_dispatch: {}

permissions: read-all

jobs:
  trunk-upgrade:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: write
      pull-requests: write
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@11bd71901bbe5b1630ceea73d27597364c9af683 # v4.2.2
      - uses: masterpointio/github-action-trunk-upgrade@abc123def456789012345678901234567890abcd # v1.0.0
        with:
          app-id: ${{ secrets.BOT_APP_ID }}
          app-private-key: ${{ secrets.BOT_APP_PRIVATE_KEY }}
          github-token: ${{ secrets.ORG_PAT }}
          reviewers: "@org/engineering"
```

## Authentication

**GitHub Token Only:**

```yaml
with:
  github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

**Dual-Token (Recommended):**

```yaml
with:
  app-id: ${{ secrets.BOT_APP_ID }}
  app-private-key: ${{ secrets.BOT_APP_PRIVATE_KEY }}
  github-token: ${{ secrets.TEAM_PAT }}
```

Dual-token setup provides better security (permission separation) and performance (higher rate limits).
